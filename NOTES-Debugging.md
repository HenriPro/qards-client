# Debugging
*  `yarn test` - Starts the native\default 'jest' test runner.

* To debug in Chrome, select "Debug JS Remotely" from the emulator's Dev Menu and look for a new tab at http://localhost:8081/debugger-ui

* 'reactotron' is sort of installed at the moment, so feel free to download\play with that. It can listen to communication between parts.

Otherwise, testing is currently exposed by the normal default which is 'jest'
